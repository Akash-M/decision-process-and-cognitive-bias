	"The concept was first put to paper by military colonel John Boyd as a decision-making process for military purposes." +
	"The OODA loop is a strategic tool in which an actor makes observations about the surrounding environment, orients " +
	"his thinking process by perceiving the important information based on the context, decides on a course of action " +
	"and finally acts on it. The entire process is iterative with loops providing feedbacks to the observe phase for " +
	"constant reorientation and adaption to different scenarios. The concept has been successfully applied in other " +
	"areas such as business strategy by companies to stay ahead of their competition. The above figure figure provides" +
	" a diagrammatic representation of the process.",
	decision_making_process:
	"The decision-making process consists of a series of steps made by the people in charge of architecting the system " +
	"design. Attempts have been made to represent the series of steps through various decision-making models. In general," +
	" decision-making can be classified broadly into two streams: normative and behavioral. Within the scope of this " +
	"thesis, the models investigated in detail under each stream are presented in the diagram above. " +
	"\n" +
	" The models falling under are the normative stream are based on sounds logical reasoning and statistics and can be " +
	"said that they are applicable mostly in an ideal world scenario wherein a perfect requirement document with no " +
	"future changes is available, alongside other factors such as ideal time, budget, team and other factors. One such " +
	"model is the Rational Economic Model(REM). " +
	"\n" +
	"The models falling under the behavioral stream are subject to cognitive limitations and normally " +
	"the ones which we can observe in real world scenarios. Two models of interest are the Recognition Primed Model(RPM)" +
	"which is a representation of naturalistic decision-making and the Bounded Rational Model(BRM).",
	rational_economic_model: "Rational Economic Model(REM) involves gathering complete information during the observe " +
	"phase. In case of any missing information, the architect would loop back and ensure all information about the " +
	"concern/problem is gathered. In the orient phase an alternative list is generated, and a ranking algorithm is " +
	"applied on this list in the decide phase to choose the optimal alternative. The validity of the alternative is" +
	" then tested and based on the validation the decision to implement is taken. " +
	"\n" +
	"REM works well in ideal world situations. However, in real world scenarios it is hard for architects to " +
	"use since they work under various real-life constraints such as time, complexity and other pressures.",
	recognition_primed_model: "Recognition Primed Model (RPM) is arguably the most common model and relies largely " +
	"on mental mind maps. In the observe phase, the architect mentally gathers information about the concern and this " +
	"is the repeated until the mental information feels complete. The orient phase involves assessing whether the" +
	"situation is familiar or not and if any expectancies are violated. More mental information gathering takes place " +
	"and assessment is made based on the outcome. A mental simulation of the alternative action is made in the decide " +
	"phase to verify whether the alternative works or not and it is then evaluated against the standards to finally " +
	"implement the decision. " +
	"\n" +
	"This model is largely used by inexperienced architects or in scenarios where architecture decisions are to be " +
	"made under extreme time pressure and other constraints which affect the decision-making quality. In many cases, " +
	"this results in sub-optimal solutions due to the influence of cognitive biases.",
	bounded_rational_model: "Bounded Rational Model(BRM) lies in between the REM and NDM. The observe phase involved" +
	"gathering of information until it is felt that it is complete. An alternative list is generated in the orient " +
	"phase. The ranking of the alternatives in the decide phase depends on the decision-makers heuristics and a " +
	"satisficing alternative is chosen. In the act phase, the satisficing alternative is evaluated against standards " +
	"and based on evaluation results, the decision is implemented."
